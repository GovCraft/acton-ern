  # acton-ern
  
  ## Overview
  
  The `acton-ern` crate provides a Rust-based implementation for handling Acton Resource Names (Arns), enabling the generation, parsing, and management of Arns within the Acton framework. This crate is designed to support cloud-native Acton-based solutions by offering robust, type-safe, and efficient ERN (Entity Resource Name) management capabilities. The functionality includes constructing, parsing, validating, and manipulating Arns according to the specified hierarchical structure used within various services.
  
  ## Acton Resource Name (ERN (Entity Resource Name)) System
  
  ### What is ERN (Entity Resource Name)?
  
  The Acton Resource Name (ERN (Entity Resource Name)) is a structured identifier used within the Acton framework to uniquely identify and manage hierarchical actors across different services and partitions. Arns are designed to reflect the hierarchical relationships of actors within the system, facilitating effective management, security, and operational oversight.
  
  ### ERN (Entity Resource Name) Structure
  
  An ERN (Entity Resource Name) is composed of several parts, each representing a specific aspect of the resource:
  
  `ern:domain:category:account:root_id/path`
  
  #### Components
  
  - **ERN (Entity Resource Name)**: Indicates that the string is an Acton Resource Name.
      - **partition**: Classifies the resource as internal or external (`acton-internal`, `acton-external`).
      - **service**: Specifies the service within Acton system that the actor belongs to.
      - **account-id**: Identifies the owner or account responsible for the actor.
      - **hierarchy/path**: Provides a path-like structure that shows the actor's position within the tree, reflecting parent-child relationships.
  
  ### Examples
  
  #### Corporate Hierarchy Actor
  
  `ern:acton-internal:hr:company123:root/departmentA/team1`
  
  This ERN (Entity Resource Name) identifies an actor representing Team 1, which is part of Department A under the HR service, managed by account `company123`.
  
  #### IoT Device in a Network Topology
  
  `ern:acton-external:iot:vendor456:root/region1/building5/floor3/device42`
  
  This ERN (Entity Resource Name) points to Device 42 located on Floor 3 of Building 5 in Region 1, managed by IoT services for the vendor account `vendor456`.
  
  ## Crate Features
  
  ### Path Construction
  
  When adding new actors to the system, construct their ERN (Entity Resource Name) by appending to the parent's ERN (Entity Resource Name) path, ensuring each actor’s ERN (Entity Resource Name) accurately reflects their position within the hierarchy.
  
  ### Dynamic Tree Manipulation
  
  If an actor is moved within the hierarchy, update their ERN (Entity Resource Name)—and potentially those of all descendants—to reflect the new path. This keeps the identification consistent and meaningful.
  
  ### Resource Management
  
  Use Arns for logging, access control, and management tools to monitor interactions, manage permissions, and track activities based on actors' hierarchical locations.
  
  ## Conclusion
  
  The `acton-ern` crate is an essential component of the Acton framework, providing a robust method for uniquely identifying and managing actors within a complex, hierarchical structure, supporting enhanced security, operational management, and clarity throughout the system.
